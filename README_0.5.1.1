# Snowmix version 0.5.1.1

This is a release of Snowmix 0.5.1 modified to compile and run on newer OS and distro releases.
You should set the enviroment variable to where SNowmix is installed. For Linux the
default location is /usr/local/lib/Snowmix-0.5.1.1. For macOS the default location
if /opt/local/lib/Snowmix-0.5.1.1. Add the following to one of the files

  ~/.profile, ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile etc. depending on your setup.

	export SNOWMIX=/usr/local/lib/Snowmix-0.5.1.1
or
	export SNOWMIX=/opt/local/lib/Snowmix-0.5.1.1

After you have run ./bootstrap as many times as it asks you to do, you can run
./bootstrapmin-opengl to enable OpenGL support if you want that. Then run

	$ make clean
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

Then you can run snowmix_demo.

Snowmix 0.5.1.1 has been tested to compile, install and run on the following:

    Linux Ubuntu - All works but see note for OpenGL.
	Ubuntu 16.04 LTS updated to 16.04.6 LTS (Native and VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - OpenGL Support (glshapes) : CPU based OSMesa and GPU based GLX (X11) works.
	Ubuntu 18.04 LTS updated to 18.04.x LTS (VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - OpenGL Support (glshapes) : CPU based OSMesa fails. Use GPU based GLX (X11).
	Ubuntu 20.04 LTS updated to 20.04.x LTS (VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - OpenGL Support (glshapes) : CPU based OSMesa fails. Use GPU based GLX (X11).

    Linux Mint - All works, but see note for OpenGL.
	Linux Mint 17.3				(VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - OpenGL Support (glshapes) : CPU based OSMesa and GPU based GLX (X11) works.
	Linux Mint 18.3				(VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - OpenGL Support (glshapes) : CPU based OSMesa and GPU based GLX (X11) works.
	Linux Mint 19.3				(VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - OpenGL Support (glshapes) : CPU based OSMesa fails. Use GPU based GLX (X11).
	Linux Mint 20 beta			(VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - OpenGL Support (glshapes) : CPU based OSMesa fails. Use GPU based GLX (X11).

    Linux Debian - All works but see notes for OpenGL.
	Debian 8.11                             (VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - OpenGL Support (glshapes) : CPU based OSMesa and GPU based GLX (X11) works.
	Debian 9.3                              (VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - OpenGL Support (glshapes) : CPU based OSMesa and GPU based GLX (X11) works.
	Debian 10.3                             (VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - OSMesa crashes. Use X11 for OpenGL support

    Linux Fedora - All works, but see note for OpenGL.
	The bootstrap will now offer to add the rpmfusion.org RPMs
	and offer to add the GStreamer from rpmfusion.org. Without it snowmix_demo will
	fail to decode some of the codecs used.

	Fedora Workstation 23 - All works	(VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - For full value, you need to add packages from rpmfusion.org
	Fedora Workstation 28, 29, 32 - All but OSMesa works	(VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - For full value, you need to add packages from rpmfusion.org
	  - OpenGL Support (glshapes) : CPU based OSMesa fails. Use GPU based GLX (X11).

    Linux Centos - CentOS works but with limitations.
	Centos 7.6				(VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - Can compile and run, also OpenGL support for x11 and
	    OSMesa.
	  - Missing gstreamer1-libav and aac codecs. As such it can
	    not run the complete snowmix_demo as demo files contain AAC
	    audio and H.264 video.
	  - As a remedy one can compile and installe the missing
	    gstreamer-libav as well as the faac/fad for GStreamer.
	Centos 8.1				(VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - You will need to enable PowerTools repo in the file
	    /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-PowerTools.repo
	    This is needed for OSMesa-devel neded for OpenGL support.
	  - OpenGL Support (glshapes) : CPU based OSMesa fails. Use GPU based GLX (X11).
	  - Missing gstreamer1-libav and aac codecs. As such it can
	    not complete the snowmix_demo as demo files contain AAC
	    audio and H.264 video.
	  - Will offer altertive way to install BWidget required for GUI Tools.
	Centos 8.2.2004				(VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - Same as for CentOS 8.1

    Linux OpenSUSE - All works but see note.
	OpenSUSE Leap 15.1 All works, but see note. (VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - By default OpenSUSE does not include non-free (patent disputed)
	    codecs such as AAC/H.264. These are required for the snowmix_demo.
	    The bootstrap program will offer to add repos and packages
	    that will fix this, If you do not say yes to adding repos
	    and packages during running bootstrap, Snowmix will still
	    compile and work, but the snowmix_demo will not fully work
	    and you are on your own regarding support for the mentioned
	    codecs. But you may not need them depending on what you want
	    to use Snowmix for.
	  - By default the distro comes with the package gstreamer-plugins-cogl.

		GNU bugs report log #39126

	    GStreamer element autovideosink does not work in VirtualBox
	    (and possibly elsewhere) with cogl plugin installed. You
	    will either have to remove the package using this command:

		sudo zypper remove gstreamer-plugins-cogl

	    Alternatively you can avoid using GStreamer element autovideosink
	    al together AND change the VIDEOSINK setting in scripts/output2screen
	    and scripts/av_output2screen to one of glimagesink, xvimagesink
	    or ximagesink depending on your use and installation.
	    The cogl may work on native hardware. Please test and report back.
	OpenSUSE Tumbleweed 20200717 - All works, but see note
	  - Same note as for OpenSUSE Leap on the nonfree codecs.
	  - Newest Tumbleweed does not have the cogl problem as Leap 15.1

    Linux Mageia - All works
	Mageia 7.1					(VirtualBox 6.1.10)

    Linux Manjaro - All works except as noted.
	Manjaro XFCE 20.0.3 minimal.			(VirtualBox 6.1.10)
	  - OpenGL Support (glshapes) : CPU based OSMesa fails. Use GPU based GLX (X11).
	  - BWidget is currently not available as packages for Manjaro. The bootstrap
	    program will offer to download and install BWidget in /usr/lib.
	    BWidget for tcl/tk is required for GUI tools to work.

    Linux Chakra - All works
	Chakra 2017.10					(VirtualBox 6.1.10)

    macOS - All works except for limited OpenGL Support. See note on this.

	BigSur		- No yet tested. bootstrap is prepared it may work.
	Catalina	- compile and works.
	Mojave		- compile and works.
	High Sierra	- compile and works.
	Sierra		- compile and works.
	Yosemite	- compile and works.
	El Capitan	- compile and works.
	Mavericks	- compile and works
	Mountain Lion	- compile and works:

    	OpenGL (glshapes) on macOS:
	===========================
	OSMesa (Off Screen Rendering - CPU based) works for all macOS version
	albeit it is slow (CPU based).

	GLX (X11 Rendering - GPU based ) is fast, but require an X11 server
	for macOS. Snowmix has been tested with the free X11 server from
	XQuartz version 2.7.11 from the website https://www.xquartz.org/

	GLX based rendering does not seem to work with macOS as guest OS on
	VirtualBox. Snowmix reports wrong pixel formats and may sometime crash.
	However it did earlier work on Yosemite and Quartz 2.7.something
	propbably 2.7.7 or earlier.

	GLX has been tested with Sierra, XQuartz and running on a MacbookPro
	where it often works, but sometimes it does not. This require debugging
	beyond the scope of this release. So GPU based OpenGL does not work for
	Snowmix-0.5.1.1 on macOS (may work on older than Sierra).
