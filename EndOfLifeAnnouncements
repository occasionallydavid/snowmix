Snowmix will from version 0.5 no longer support execution of the following
commands:

	overlay feed ...
	overlay image ...
	overlay virtual feed ...

The commands are still available in Snowmix 0.4.x. The commands has been
replaced in Snowmix-0.4.4 by the following commands:

	feed overlay ...
	image overlay ...
	virtual feed ...

The command *feed overlay* is an addition to to the *stack* command providing
control for when a feed is overlayed/mixed.

The command *shape overlay* has been added the identical command
*shape place overlay*. The latter form is recommended from version 0.4.4 and
onwards as the form *shape overlay* will be removed from version 0.5.x
	
Snowmix will from version 0.5 no longer support execution of snowmix commands through returned string from the Tcl Interpreter. Until then the follwoing is still supported

	command create example.tcl
	  proc my_example {} {
	    set s "\ntext string 1 This is an example\n"
	    return $s
	  }
	command end
	tcl exec example.tcl
	tcl eval my_example

The above example is setting the text string from within the Tcl Interpreter. From version
0.5.x this has to be implemented as shown below


	command create example.tcl
	  proc my_example {} {
	    set s "text string 1 This is an example"
	    snowmix parse $s
	  }
	command end
	tcl exec example.tcl
	tcl eval my_example

The Tcl interpreter command **snowmix parse** was introduced for Snowmix version 0.4.4
