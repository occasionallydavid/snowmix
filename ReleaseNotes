Release Notes for Snowmix Version 0.5.1
Copyright 2016 - Peter Maersk-Moller
Released 9th February 2016

Please read the Release note from http://snowmix.sourceforge.net/Documentation/releasenotes.html
or see below.

Overall Theme:
	The overall theme for this Snowmix release 0.5.1 is to release GUI programs for
	controlling Snowmix for Live video production. Secondary, this release includes
	a number of bugfixes and smaller improvements overall making Snowmix even more
	stable and dependable for a Live production environment.

New GUI Programs:
	The GUI program snowcub.tcl is no longer included, but have been replaced by
	programs such as snowaudio.tcl, snowscene.tcl and snowoutput.tcl.

	The program snowaudio.tcl is a GUI program that can be used to control and
	mix audio in a live production environment running Snowmix. Snowaudio.tcl
	reads its configuration from a running session of Snowmix.

	The program snowscene.tcl is a GUI program that can be used to control and
	mix video scenes in a live production environment running Snowmix. Snowscene.tcl
	reads its configuration from a running session of Snowmix.

	The program snowoutput.tcl is a GUI program that can be used to monitor the
	output statistics of Snowmix in a live production environment.

New commands:
	The following new commands, enhancements, improvements and bugfixes are included
	in this version. Details can be found in the Changelog.

	1) Tcl command *snowmix info output ((info | status) [ format ]) | syntax*.

Enhancements and improvements:
	1) 24 bit RGB PNG images are now supported in addition to 32 bit RGBA.
	2) Audio clipping range changed from betwenn -32768 and 32767 to
	   now -32767 tand 32767.
	3) Cleanup for the command *tcl help*.
	4) Cosmetic cleanup for command *audio sink status*.
	5) Cosmetic cleanup for the tcl command
	   *snowmix info audio mixer source extended format*
	7) Changes to the Snowmix Library command "SceneSetFrameActive".
	8) Adding konsole and xfc4-terminal to snowmix_demo script.
	
Bugfixes:
	1) Deleting or loading an image into an existing image place holder
	   would leak memory.
	2) Text grow would fail for certain combination of UTF8 multi character
	   strings.
	3) Text background had switched rb values for the *text backgr rgb* command.
	4) Tcl command *snowmix info* would in some case make Snowmix dump core.
	5) Snowmix audio mixer had problems adjusting the audio level when source
	   had fewer channels than the mixer it self.
	6) Audio mixer would in some cases not detect audio clipping correct.
	7) Unbalanced list for the tcl command *snowmix info audio mixer source info ...*.
	8) The command *audio feed delay <feed id> <ms>* would print to stderr and
	   not the controlling channel.
	9) The tcl command *snowmix info audio mixer source* printed wrong
	   value for mute. The same applied for the command
	   *snowmix info audio feed status ...* and *snowmix info audio sink status ...*.
	10) Format error for the tcl command *snowmix info audio mixer source ...*.
	11) images/CS directory was not installed (minor issue).
	12) Output2screen could potentially hang on some systems.
	13) The snowmix_demo script could hang on Linux systems without gnome_terminal.
	14) Tcl include files that are not executable directly, are now installed
	    as data files with mode 644.
	15) Snowmix on OS X could exit without a warning if a connecting shmsrc exits.

Compile and install:
	Please see the compile and install instructions for version 0.5.1 on
	http://snowmix.sourceforge.net/Intro/compileandinstall.html
	Support for OpenGL is still considered alpha code and not enabled by default.
	To enable support for OpenGL, please run the command before running make:

		./configure --prefix=$prefix --libdir=$prefix=lib --enable-snowmixosmesa \
			--enable-snowmixx11 --enable-snowmixglu --enable-snowmixglut

	The variable $prefix is usually /opt/local for Mac OS X and /usr/local for all others.
	Alternatively use the file bootstrapmin-opengl

Tested platforms:
	This version of Snowmix has before release been tested on:

	- Mac OS X 10.11.3 El Capitan.
	- Mac OS X 10.08.5 Mountain Lion.
	- Mac OS X 10.09.5 Maverick.
	- Mac OS X 10.10.5 Yosemite.
	- Linux Centos 7 15.11 amd64 (See comments)
	- Linux Chakra 15.11 Fermi amd64. (See comments)
	- Linux Debian 8.2 amd64. (See comments)
	- Linux Fedora Workstation 23 amd64. (See comments)
	- Linux Mint Cinnamon 17.2 amd64.
	- Linux OpenSUSE Leap 42.1 amd64.
	- FreeBSD PCBSD10.2. (See comment about /bin/bash)
	- Linux Ubuntu 14.04 LTS amd64, ARMv7.
	- Linux Ubuntu 15.11 amd64.

Comments on installing on various platforms:
Mac OS X:The bootstrap script will install all that is needed.
CentOS: You need to add rights to do 'sudo' for the user compiling and installing
	Snowmix.  The program snowmix_demo needs encoder and decoder modules for
	GStreamer for H.264 and AAC (unclear how get this). 
Chakra: Compiles and runs fine, but needs BWidget to run GUI apps. BWidget seems
	not to be available for Chakra although it is for Arch Linux. You may
	be able to download and install BWidget from Sourceforge manually.
Debian: Needs package 'sudo' to be installed. Need to add rights to do 'sudo' for
	the user download and install missing tools/libs and for installing Snowmix.
Fedora: Fedora 23. You need to add the rpmfusion repository and install relevant gstreamer
	plugins to run the snowmix_demo. Similar for Fedora 22, but untested.
	sudo rpm -Uvh http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-23.noarch.rpm
	sudo rpm -Uvh http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-23.noarch.rpm
	sudo dnf install gstreamer-plugins-bad gstreamer-plugins-bad-free-extras gstreamer-plugins-bad-nonfree gstreamer-plugins-ugly gstreamer-ffmpeg gstreamer1-libav gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free-extras gstreamer1-plugins-bad-freeworld gstreamer1-plugins-base-tools gstreamer1-plugins-good-extras gstreamer1-plugins-ugly gstreamer1-plugins-bad-free gstreamer1-plugins-good gstreamer1-plugins-base gstreamer1
Mint:	The bootstrap script will install all that is needed.
PCBSD:	You need to execute the following command "sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/bash /bin/bash"
	for the scripts to work. Run all commands in bash rather than other shells.
	No video/image sinks was found for GStreamer1.0 for PCBSD10.2.
	No 'wish' needed for tcl GUI programs was found.
OpenSUSE: The package gstreamer-plugins-libav isn't found by zypper. You need to
	find the right version yourself and install it manually. Without it, you may
	miss important decoders such as decoder for H.264 etc.
Ubuntu:	The bootstrap script will install all that is needed.

		Release Notes for Snowmix Version 0.5.0
		Copyright 2015 - Peter Maersk-Moller
		Released 31st July 2015

The overall theme for this Snowmix release 0.5.0 is to make Snowmix installable
as a regular program. Furthermore the theme is also to add support for
industry standard OpenGL 3D graphics both Off Screen CPU based and
hardware accelerated GPU based rendering. In addition to these overall themes,
this release come with a number of bugfixes, speed-ups, cosmetic changes
and EndOfLife implementations.

This version's release notes are especially important to pay attention to for
those of you who have been using earlier versions of Snowmix. Because Snowmix
is now changing its major version number, a long list of commands are
now changing their syntax or are being retired as earlier made clear
in the EndOfLife announcements. Please see the EndofLife Announcement
for this version to see the list of commands and functionality now
changing or retirering. This is also listed in the ChangeLog.

In addition to these changes, it is also important to know that from
this version on, the file names in the ini file given for feed control
sockets and system socket must be given as an absolute file name starting
with a leading '/'. This mean that you will have to change this in your
ini files, if you are reusing ini files from previous versions.

Snowmix will from this version and on refuse to run, if the environment
variable SNOWMIX has not been set to the install path of Snowmix. By
default, when Snowmix is running the configure command as part of the
bootstrap script, the install prefix is set to /usr/local for all but
Mac OS X and to /opt/local for the latter. If you have an install prefix
being /usr/local, you must set the enviroment variable SNOWMIX to be:

	export SNOWMIX=/usr/local/lib/Snowmix-0.5.0

If you do not do this, Snowmix will not work properly.

From this version and on, Snowmix will, unless filename is absolute and
starting with a leading '/', be using a search path when:

	- include an ini file for reading
	- include a Snowmix library file (slib directory)
	- load an image file for reading
	- load a dead-image file for a feed (from the frames directory)
	- open an audio sink output file for writing
	- open an image file for writing

The search path will contain the following paths in this order:

	Current working directory
	$HOME/$SNOWMIX_PREFIX
	$SNOWMIX

If the environment variable SNOWMIX_PREFIX has not been set to a name,
Snowmix will for Mac OS X use 'Snowmix' and for all other use '.snowmix'.
If you in your ini file include the following files:

	# First file
	include ../ini/my_ini_file
	# Second file
	include ini/my_ini_file
	# Third file
	include /ini/my_ini_file

Then Snowmix will for the first file look for my_ini_file in this order:

	'current working directory'/../ini/my_ini_file
	$HOME/$SNOWMIX_PREFIX/../ini/my_ini_file
	$SNOWMIX/../ini/my_ini_file

If a file is found, the file will will be includes and no further search
is done. If all search paths fails, the include command fails.

The second file will be attempted read as

	'current working directory'/ini/my_ini_file
	$HOME/$SNOWMIX_PREFIX/ini/my_ini_file
	$SNOWMIX/ini/my_ini_file

Third filename is absolute, so Snowmix will only attempt to read the file
/ini/my_ini_file.

So go over your older ini files and probably remove the '../' for images,
audio sinks etc. and you will probably also copy your old ini files to
$HOME/.snowmix/ini/ for Linux and $HOME/Snowmix/ini/ for Mac OS X.
See also the ChangeLog for more details on this.

In addition to the 72 new glshape commands, this version adds the following
3 commands:

	feed drop <feed id> <n drops>
	if exist(image,<image id>)
	shape newsubpath <shape id>

Details are found in the ChangeLog.

Snowmix now support installation on CentOS. However see the ChangeLog for a missing
component of GStreamer on CentOS.

This version of Snowmix has before release been tested on:

	Linux Ubuntu 14.04 LTS amd64, ARMv7.
	Linux Centos 7 15.03 amd64
	Linux Chakra 14.11 Euler amd64.
	Linux Debian 7.7 amd64.
	Linux Mint Cinnamon 17.1, 17.2 amd64.
	Linux Fedora Workstation 21 amd64.
	Mac OS X 10.09 Maverick.
	Mac OS X 10.10.4 Yosemite.

		Release Notes for Snowmix Version 0.4.5
		Copyright 2015 - Peter Maersk-Moller
		Released january 21st 2015

The overall theme for Snowmix release 0.4.5 has been to update and expand
the commands and command api for virtual feeds and bring it more
in-line with the capabilities of Snowmix images, shapes, feeds and texts.
Virtual feeds now support anchoring, alignment and handle offset
for rotation correct.

This release also updates aspects of Snowmix image commands along the
same lines. Furthermore Snowmix can now create new images or snapshots
of images sourced from other images, feeds and the main mixer frame.
Controls include clip, scale, rotation and alpha. With this feature,
the main mixer frame can be used to create complex images and then a
snapshot can be taken. After that clearing the main mixer frame is
required before mixing the frame for output is done.

In this release is also optimization of text command parsing and
text overlay. This and the other optimization has reduced the
Snowmix load on an old Thinkpad T61 from 23-24% to 18-19% using
the ini/basic_feeds example. Other settings with larger
geometries, fewer text overlays etc. may show less performance gain.

IMPORTANT: This release includes an End Of Life Announcement for a
number of commands syntax and some functionality. This is as always
described in the file EndOfLifeAnnouncements. If you write your own
ini files and/or Snowmix scripts or in some way interact with Snowmix
through external programs, please read the file EndOfLifeAnnouncements.

This version introduces the following new 17 commands:

	- image geometry [<place id>]
	- image move offset [<place id> <delta offset x> <delta offset y> <step offset x> <step offset y>]
	- image place anchor [<place id> (n | s | e | w | c | ne | nw | se | sw)]
	- image source [(feed | image | frame) <image id> <source id> [ <offset x> <offset y> <width> height> [<scale_x> <scale_y> [<rotation> <alpha> [(fast | good | best | nearest | bilinear | gaussian)]]]]]
	- image verbose [<level>]
	- shape place anchor [<place id> (n | s | e | w | c | ne | nw | se | sw)]
	- text place anchor [<place id> (n | s | e | w | c | ne | nw | se | sw)]
	- text offset [<place id> <offset x> <offset y>]
	- vfeed align [<vir id> (left | center | right ) ( top | middle | bottom)]
	- vfeed alpha [ <vir id> <alpha> ]
	- vfeed anchor [<vir id> (n | s | e | w | c | ne | nw | se | sw)]
	- vfeed coor [<vir id> <x> <y>]
	- vfeed clip [<vir id> <clip w> <clip h> <src_x> <src_y>]
	- vfeed info
	- vfeed move offset [<vir id> <delta offset x> <delta offset y> <step offset x> <step offset y>]
	- vfeed rotation [<vir id> <rotation>]
	- vfeed scale [<vir id> <scale_x> <scale_y>]
	- vfeed verbose [<level>]

Please see the ChangeLog file for detailed information on new commands.
This release also include a newly created reference manual for *vfeed*
commands as well as a newly created reference manual for *image* commands.
Please finde these manuals at

  - Reference Images : https://sourceforge.net/p/snowmix/wiki/Reference%20Images/
  - Reference Virtual Feeds : https://sourceforge.net/p/snowmix/wiki/Reference%20Virtual%20Feeds/

This versions adds/change the following functions to the Snowmix Libraries

	- tcl eval FeedWatch <feed id>
	- tcl eval FeedUnWatch <feed id>
	- tcl eval FeedWatchCommand <feed id> <state> <command>
	- tcl eval FeedWatchCheck
	- tcl eval ScenePush <scene id> [ <fade> ]
	- tcl eval ScenePop [ <fade> ]

Please see the ChangeLog file for detailed information on these new functions.

The recommended platform is still Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS amd64 with GStreamer-1.4.x,
but other platforms are supported as well.

In addition to previous announced support for various OS and distros,
this release adds support for:

	Linux Debian 7.7.0 Wheezy (tested with amd64)
	Linux Chakra 2014.11 Euler (tested with amd64)
	Linux OpenSUSE 12.3 Harlequin (tested with amd64)

As always this release includes a long list og bugfixes and cosmetic corrections. Please see the ChangeLog file for detailed information on this.

FOR LINUX UBUNTU:

	- All works well.

FOR LINUX MINT:

	- All works well. Replace autovideosink with ximagesink in
	scripts/output2screen and scripts/av_output2screen if you have
	problem with seeing the mixed result when running scripts/demo.

FOR LINUX DEBIAN:

	- You need to add your login name to the group sudo in the
	/etc/group file before running the bootstrap script. This script
	will check for and install missing packages. After adding your
	login name you need to logout and login again before running the
	bootstrap script.

FOR LINUX FEDORA:

	- You need to find a GStreamer package with support H.264 encoding
	and decoding to get the full value of the demo script and the
	example scripts for feeding H.264 encoded video for Snowmix and
	for encoding Live video from Snowmix. You quite likely also want
	an AAC encoder/decoder and MP3 encoder/decoder fo GStreamer, but
	Snowmix is compiling cleanly.

FOR LINUX OPENSUSE:

	- The package gstreamer-plugins-libav does not seem to be available
	for OpenSUSE 12.3. As such H.264 encoding and decoding seems to
	be missing for GStreamer for now. For this, some of the scripts
	for input and output to Snowmix will not work with H.264 video.

	- The scripts output2screen and av_output2screen uses GStreamer
	autovideosink selecting glimagesink. This works poorly on
	OpenSUSE 12.3 running in a VirtualBox. You may replace autovideosink
	in multiple places in both scripts with ximagesink or better with
	xvimagesink if you have it. Use 'gst-inspect-1.0 xvimagesink'
	to check.

FOR CHAKRA:
	- The bootstrap script will install the packages openbsd-netcat,
	bc and gst-libav, if they are missing.


For Mac OS X:

	- The GUI control called snowcub.tcl does not work. You can run
	  the GUI control from a Linux installation, perhaps in a VirtualBox
	  installation on your Mac. Snowmix will offer to install macports
	  and tools and libraries needed for autoconfigurering, compiling
	  and linking Snowmix.

IMPORTANT: Should you experience problems during installation, then please
tell us so through the support forum so we can improve the package.
	  
Enjoy the Snowmix version 0.4.5

		Release Notes for Snowmix Version 0.4.4
		Copyright 2014 - Peter Maersk-Moller

The overall theme for Snowmix release 0.4.4 has been to expand the number of
supported platforms beyond Ubuntu Desktop amd64. Snowmix now installs and run
on the following platforms:

	- Ubuntu amd64/i386/i686/ARMv7.
	- Fedora Live Desktop amd64 and i386/i686.
	- Linux Mint amd64 and i386/i686.
	- Mac OS X Mountain Lion and Maverick 64bit

Another overall theme for this release has been to provide communication
between the embedded Tcl Interpreter and Snowmix internals. Embedded scripts can now query Snowmix settings directly as well as execute Snowmix commands directly without wating for a function to return.

Last but not least, the Snowmix Libraries \(slib) have been overhauled and are now supported although they are considered alpha code. Please help test it. Most notably among the libraries is the Scenes Libraries offering advanced video mixing functionality. The Scenes pane on the GUI snowcub.tcl has been rewritten and expanded quite a lot wrt. to functionality. The support for Snowmix libraries are followed up by documentation on the following pages:

			Release Notes for Snowmix Version 0.4.3

			  Copyright 2013 - Peter Maersk-Moller
				     January 17th 2014

The overall theme for Snowmix release 0.4.3 has been to fix bugs, correct
minor cosmetic errors to streamline the use of Snowmix, improving the bootstrap
and compilation process, adding script support for GStreamer 1.0 and offer better
control of the output process. Last but not least, the restrictions on scale
and PAR for video feeds has been removed and the CPU required for mixing video
feed with odd scales or PAR considerably lowered.

This release also introduces the following 7 new commands:

	audio mixer source [delete <mixer id> <source no>]
	feed alpha [<feed id> <alpha>]
	system name [<system name>]
	system output buffers <buffer count>
	system output delay <frames>
	system output mode <mode>
	system output reset

Details are available in the ChangeLog file. Individual highlights of changes
and improvements are:

  1) Removing restictions on scale and PAR for video feeds as well as speeding
     up video stacking of feeds for odd scales and PAR.
  2) Overlay finish and pre can now list the command name associated.
  3) Audio feed, mixer and sink no longer have erronous counter wrap after
     27+ hours at 44100Hz.
  4) A mixer source can now be deleted/changed.
  5) Issues when closing a controller channel is now fixed.
  6) Better control of output. It can be reset and can now operate in one of
     3 modes. It also offers a number of commands for fine tuning and listing.
  7) Snowmix can now use 1 of 2 different mixer loops. The loops differ in how
     timing is handled.
  8) System name added.
  9) System socket can now be listed.
  10) More information with the system info command.
  11) Scripts made more robust and updated for GStreamer-1.0
  12) Overhaul of bootstrap process. Better support for Ubuntu 12.10, 13.04 and 13.10.

			Release Notes for Snowmix Version 0.4.2

			  Copyright 2013 - Peter Maersk-Moller
				     July 31st 2013

The overall theme for Snowmix release 0.4.2 has been to fix bugs and correct
minor cosmetic errors to streamline the use of Snowmix. The relase also
includes some perfomance enhancements as well as adding animation to audio
volumes. The release is compatible with ini files for version 0.4.x with
the exceptions that some commands as explained in the ChangeLog has
minor changes to the result.

This release introduce the following 12 new commands:

	audio feed move volume - animation of volume for audio feeds.
	audio mixer move volume - animation of volume for audio mixers.
	audio mixer source move volume - animation of volume for source for audio mixers.
	audio sink move volume - animation of volume for audio sinks.
	shape arcrel_cw - relative placement of an arc element
	shape arcrel_cww - relative placement of an arc element
	shape source alphaadd - adding a constant to the alpha level.
	shape source alphamul - multiply a factor to the alpha level.
	shape tell scale - for debugging purposes.
	text place backgr round - for round corners of text background.
	text place font - quick change of the font of a placed text.
	text place string - quick change of the string of a placed text.

Further details are available in the ChangeLog.

This release has been performance optimized and/or enhanced further in the
following ares or for the specific commands:

	Update loop of all placed text using the animation command *move*.
	Parsing of all **text** commands.
	Parsing of all **feed** commands.
	All **text place** commands are now checked and will return error in case of error.
	Command image load now closes the file it reads.
	The command text grow is now by default using a fixed size for placing and for background, but size can be set variable if desired.
	feed list - cometic changes
	feed info - additional information
	feed add - can now list feeds as other add comands.

Further details are available in the ChangeLog.

This release fixes a couple of bugs for the following commands:

	shape list - was not listing all entries in a shape correctly.
	shape source rgb/rgba - was mixing the print of the two variants in verbose mode.
	shape help - missing rectangle entry.
	shape recursion - made a printing error in verbose mode.
	shape line width - cosmetic printing error in verbose mode.
	shape inshape - cosmetic printing error in verbose mode.
	shape arc_ccw - was parsed incorrectly and thus unusable.
	shape list help - was printing incorrect syntax for some commands.
	shape move entry - was in some cases erronously deleting an entry.
	text string concat - was core dumping.
	pattern add - was deleting a shape rather than a pattern.

Further details are available in the ChangeLog.

In addition to the enhancements and fixes of Snowmix, the control and validation tool snowcub.tcl has been updated with more functions. Snowcub remain currently undocumented.

Last but not least, a collection of Snowmix library functions implemented in Tcl is available in the slib library. These functions includes scene creation and management, clocks, graphs and a radar application that can be used in Snowmix and controlled by Snowcub.

As always, you can the updated information on how to compile and run the demo on:

			Release Notes for Snowmix Version 0.4.1

			  Copyright 2013 - Peter Maersk-Moller
				     4th July 2013


The overall theme for Snowmix release 0.4.1 has been to add shapes to Snowmix.
Shapes adds support for complex graphics and image drawing, clipping, patterns,
gradients and masking using graphic primitives of the 2D Cairo Graphics library.
In this context, a video feed is an image that happens to change at the frame
rate.  More information on the Cairo Graphics library is available at
http://cairographics.org/

In Snowmix shapes are macros with zero or more Cairo Graphics commands. This
release adds support for the following 46 new basic shapes commands where
the Cairo Graphics commands are marked with *)

	shape add
	shape arc_cw		*)
	shape arc_ccw		*)
	shape clip		*)
	shape closepath		*)
	shape curveto		*)
	shape curverel		*)
	shape feed		*)
	shape fill		*)
	shape fill preserve	*)
	shape help
	shape info
	shape image		*)
	shape inshape		*)
	shape line width	*)
	shape line join		*)
	shape line cap		*)
	shape lineto		*)
	shape linerel		*)
	shape list
	shape mask pattern	*)
	shape moveentry
	shape moverel		*)
	shape moveto		*)
	shape newpath		*)
	shape operator		*)
	shape overlay
	shape paint		*)
	shape pattern add
	shape pattern radial	*)
	shape pattern linear	*)
	shape pattern stoprgb	*)
	shape recursion
	shape restore		*)
	shape rotation		*)
	shape save		*)
	shape scale		*)
	shape source rgb	*)
	shape source rgba	*)
	shape source pattern	*)
	shape stroke		*)
	shape stroke preserve	*)
	shape translate		*)
	shape transform		*)
	shape verbose
	shape place help

For most shape commands their names (largely), function and parameter values
are identical to the corresponding commands available in the Cairo Graphics
library. For this reason, much documentation on the use and function of the
graphic primitives are available on the Cairo Graphics webpages.

A placed shape is an abstraction of a shape with coordinates (its placement),
a rotation, a scale, an offset, a base color and an alpha value. In addition
to the basic shape commands, the release also adds support for the following 14
shape place commands:

	shape place
	shape place alpha
	shape place coor
	shape place move alpha
	shape place move coor
	shape place move offset
	shape place move rotation
	shape place move scale
	shape place offset
	shape place rgb
	shape place rotation
	shape place scale
	shape place shape
	shape place status 

The 5 move commands adds animation for placed shapes for scale, coordinates, rotation,
offset and alpha blend.

Other new commands in this release are:

	messagef
	text place clipabs
	image write
	audio mixer source invert
	system host allow

The image write command is not recommended used for live systems due to possible delay.

In addition to the new commands, a number of changes and bugfixes are also included in
this release. Details for these new commands are listed in the ChangeLog.

To install and run demo, please execute the following commands:

	$ tar -xzvf Snowmix-0.4.1
	$ cd Snowmix-0.4.1
	$ sh bootstrap
	$ ./configure
	$ make
	$ cd scripts
	$ bash demo
