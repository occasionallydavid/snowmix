		<h3>Features Under Consideration.</h3>
		<div class="descr">Being planned.</div>
		<br/>

		<p>The following features are on the development map, but the version for
		which the feature has not yet been decided.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Groups. group text, images, shapes. A single command for a group
			will operate on all members of the group. Scaling, moving, rotation,
			alpha blending and animation.
			<li>Video Filters. Chroma key is under consideration for version 0.6,
			but Snowmix already supports chroma keying through gstreamer modules
			alpha and alphacolor.
			<li>Audio Filters.
			<li>Multiple Output modules for video as opposed to currently only one.
			<li>Snowcub: Overhaul and updating of the GUI tool that can control flow and mixing with Snowmix.

		<h3>Snowmix 0.5.1</h3>
		<div class="descr">100% done and released February 9th 2016</div>
		<br/>

		<p>This version will add GUI tools for Live video production. Bugfixes for
		making Snowmix even more stable and suitable for Live video production.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="item">

		<h3>Snowmix 0.5.0</h3>
		<div class="descr">100% done and released July 2015</div>
		<br/>

		<p>This version will support OpenGL 3D graphics and texture manipulation of feeds,
		images and graphic elements. This version will allow for 3D overlay of video feeds
		and images including 3D placement, 3D rotation, alpha blending and perhaps clipping.</p>

		<p>OpenGL will be supported as "Off Screen" CPU based rendering using
		<a href="http://www.mesa3d.org/osmesa.html" target="_blank">OSNesa</a> as well as hardware accelerated GPU
		based rendering using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLX" target="_blank">GLX</a>.</p>

		<p>The OpenGL support for Snowmix-0.5 is to be considered alpha code and will not
		be recommended for production setups.</p>

		<h3>Snowmix 0.4.6</h3>
		<div class="descr">100% done and never released. Included in 0.5.0</div>
		<br/>


		<p>This version <strong>will be installable</strong> and will be suited to include
		in distros such as Linux distros etc. This version will require the environment
		variable SNOWMIX to point to where the Snowmix files will be installed, typically
		/usr/local/lib/Snowmix-0.4.6 or /opt/local/lib/Snowmix-0.4.6.</p>

		<p>Snowmix will apply a search path when loading images with a relative path, including
		files with a relative path and when searching for the ini file if given with a relative
		path and when writing an audio sink to a file with a relative path.</p>

		<p>This version will also install snowcub.tcl to be used as a program from anywhere.</p>

	<div class="item">

		<h3>Snowmix 0.4.5</h3>
		<div class="descr">100% done and released January 21st 2015</div>
		<br/>

		<p>The overall theme for this version is an overhaul of the <strong>virtual feed</strong>
		abilities for Snowmix. Adding commands for setting coordinates, scale, clip and alpha
		individually.</p>

		<p>Aligning virtual feed clipping and scaling with rest of Snowmix.</p>

		<p>Reference manual for virtual feeds.</p>

		<p>Fixing writing data on control connections to use select call and buffering.</p>

		<p>Fixing vulnerability for stall if audio sinks stalls.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="item">

		<h3>Snowmix 0.4.5</h3>
		<div class="descr">100% done and released September 3rd 2014</div>
		<br/>

		<p>The overall theme of this release will be to add support for other platforms and
		to aide or automate the setup for compilation of Snowmix on these platforms.
		Supported platforms will be Linux (Ubuntu and Fedora) for both i386/i686/amd64/ARMv7
		and Mac OS X originally planned for version 0.7.</p>

		<p>As always, the release will also include optimization and bugfixes.</p>

		<p>This relase will also add UTF-8 formatted international character support for text strings.</p>

		<p>The Tcl interpreter will be able to pass Snowmix commands for immidiate parsing
		and execution as well query for a wide range internal Snowmix settings for text,
		images, feeds, shapes etc. originally planned for rlease 0.7.
		This is an important step for advanced scripting.</p>

		<p>The code will furthermore be analyzed to remove potential memory leaks
		and potential pointer NULL references as malformed commands in some cases can lead
		to crashing Snowmix.</p>

		<p>Snowmix libraries slibs will be partly documented and fully supported.</p>
