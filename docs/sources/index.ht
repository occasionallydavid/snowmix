				<cite>This tool really lets me focus on the application logic of my video mixing app.</cite>

				<a href="https://sourceforge.net/u/matthew1000/profile/">Matthew Clark</a>:</p>

				<cite>Snowmix is a very useful tool. We use it for live video/audio mixing. It provides all
				the essential features to switch streams, merge video (picture-in-picture, etc.), add graphics
				and combine audio streams. It can be controlled remotely, and we've successfully deployed
				Snowmix on the cloud. The support provided by Peter is also excellent.</cite>

				<p>Quote from from the user
				<a href="https://sourceforge.net/u/dfantoma/profile/">Diego Fantoma</a>:</p>

				<cite>The greatest open source live video project I've ever seen.
				It works fine, it's very easy to install and to understand, offering
				a lot of possible scenario of use and - not less important - it takes
				a very small footprint in terms of resources. The author is very quick
				and detailed in answering to questions. Great, great, great! </cite>

				<cite>Fantastic video mixer. Does all I could ever need it to do with less
				overhead than I could ask for. Configuration is a breeze and the app itself
				is light and efficient.</cite>
