		<h3>Happy with the Snowmix Video Mixer?</h3>
		<br/>
		<p>Snowmix is being developed as an Open Source Project with no funding and based
		alone on the volounteer work of the developer. The project is being developed
		to provide the base for Live TV transmissions of rocket launches for another Open
		Source volounteer based project <a href="http://www.copsub.com/" target="_blank">Copenhagen Suborbitals</a>.</p>

		<p>If you are happy with the Snowmix Video Mixer, please consider making a small
		donation to help ensure the further development of Snowmix. Whether your donation
		is 1, 5, 10 or more dollars, all donations are much appreciated.</p>


		<p>It is preferred that you donate by <a href="https://www.paypal.com/myaccount/transfer/send" target=_blank">direct transfer to Snowmix.Video@gmail.com through Paypal</a>. The receiver should be Snowmix.Video@gmail.com. Alternatively you can use the following buttons to donate an amount of your own choosing either through PayPal or through Flattr.</p>

		<p>All donations are used 100% to finance further development of Snowmix. While
		developing is fun, documenting Snowmix to enable others to use Snowmix for free
		in any meaningful way, is a tedious and laborous work.</p>

		<p>Thank you for consider donating to this project, if not today, then perhaps tomorrow.</p>
