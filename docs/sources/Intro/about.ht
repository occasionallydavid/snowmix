		graphics also native support for 3D graphics through OpenGL support. Both
		off-screen (CPU based) and hardware accelerated (GPU) OpenGL rendering are
		supported.</p>

		<h3>What is Snowmix not?</h3>
		<br/>
		<p><Strong>Snowmix is NOT an application</strong>, but rather a highly advanced and
		specialized tool. As it is with many tools, its full potential depends on the
		abilities, knowledge, skills and talent of the user.</p>

		<p>Are you looking for an easy point-and-click solution, Snowmix is
		<strong>not</strong> your solution.</p>

		<p>Are you on the other side looking for a Swiss Army Knife of Open Source
		Live Video Mixing for building your own video mixer application or
		system and prepared to read the necessary doucmentation to acquire information,
 		chances are that you have come to the right place.</p>

		<h3>Why is Snowmix designed the way it is?</h3>
		<br/>
		<p>Snowmix was originally developed (and still is) by the author for producing
		Live streaming television from the rocket launches in the Baltic Sea by
		<a href="http://www.copsub.com">Copenhagen Suborbitals.</a></p>.
		<p>You can see many of the
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPzFMJIsp2fOQ_ic5a_zXTA">videos from Copenhagen Suborbitals on YouTube</a>.</p>

		<p>Due to the nature of the task, Snowmix is designed to run headerless and to
		be controlled remotely over low bandwidth TCP connections.</p>
