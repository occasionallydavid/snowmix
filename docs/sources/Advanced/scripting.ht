		<h1>Advanced Scripting</h1>
		<div class="descr">Updated for Snowmix 0.5.1.1</div>
		<br/>

		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<br/>

		<p>Snowmix offers both
		<a href="[HOME]Examples/scripting.html">basic scripting</a>
		and advanced scripting. This page will over time present how to do advanced scripting
		and it is recommended that the concepts for basic scripting is well understood
		before advanced scripting is undertaken.</p>
		<br/>

		<p>Advanced scripting in Snowmix means taking advantage of the built-in
                <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/snowmix/wiki/Tcl%20Interpreter/" target="_blank">Tcl Interpreter</a>.
		and using it for executing complex command sets possibly depending of a
		complex set of states. Determining the state, scripts executed by the built-in interpreter
		may involve queries into internal Snowmix settings.</p>
