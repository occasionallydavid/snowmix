		<a name="prep"><h3>Preparations and bootstrap.</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>To compile, install and run Snowmix, Snowmix source code must be
		<a href="downloads.html">downloaded</a> onto a <a href="requirements.html#platforms">supported platform</a>.
		Furthermore Snowmix <a href="requirements.html#software">requires a number of libraries and tools</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>The good news is that Snowmix's boostrap script will detect platform and offer to install
		any missing packages or libraries if any.</strong></p>
		<div align="right"><a href="">Top</a></div>

	</div>

	<div class="item">
		<a name="sudo"><h3>Sudo.</h3></a>

		<p>The bootstrap script will use the command
		<i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo" target="_blank">sudo</a></i> for
		installing any missing packages and you will be required to provide your password for <i>sudo</i>
		for the boostrap script to succeed.</p>

		<p>If you are uncomfortable providing the password to the boostrap script, you can alternatively
		install any missing packages yourself beforehand. See the list of
		<a  href="requirements.html#software">required software here</a>.
		The bootstrap script will then either detect the installed packages or ask to
		skip detecting possibly missing packages and proceed without executing sudo
		needing the password. Unfortunately this does not fully apply for the Mac OS X, but you
		can look in the boostrap script for any wrong doing your self. See also
		<a href="#nosudo">Bootstrapping without sudo</a>.</p>


		<p>For some distros, the users do not by default have access to execute <i>sudo</i>
		commands. To have access to execute the *sudo* command on a Debian based system, you
		need to add your username to the sudo group in the /etc/group file. Alternatively you
		may be able as root to run the following command adding your account to the sudo group:</p>

		<code># adduser YOUR_USERNAME sudo</code>

		<p>After adding your username to the sudo group, you need to log out and log
		in again. Alterntive to adding your user name to the sudo group, you can as root alter
		the /etc/sudoers file to grant you access to execute the sudo command. This takes effect
		immediately. If <i>sudo</i> is not installed, you need to add the <i>sudo</i> as root. If
		<i>sudo</i> is not installed on a Debian or Ubuntu derrived distros, you can execute the
		following command to install sudo:</p>
		<code>su -
apt-get install sudo</code>

		<div align="right"><a href="">Top</a></div>
	</div>

	<div class="item">

		<a name="manualinstall"><h3>Installing required packages manually.</h3></a>
		<br/>
		<p>On Ubuntu and Ubuntu derrived distros you can manually install the
		<a href="requirements.html#software">required packages</a> using the following command:</p>

		<code>sudo apt-get install build-essential automake make autoconf libtool g++ pkg-config \
	bc libpng-dev libsdl1.2-dev libpango1.0-dev tcl-dev tcl tk \
	bwidget liborc-0.4-dev libosmesa6-dev freeglut3-dev freeglut3-dev</code>

		<p>The <i>sdo apt-get install</i> or <i>sudo apt intsall</i> may work on Debian as well.</p>

		<p>Some Ubuntu/Debian alike distros may require tcl8.6-dev or tcl8.5-dev instead of tcl-dev.
		tcl-dev in one of its versions/incarnations is needed by Snowmix to include the embedded
		Interpreter offering <a href="../Advanced/scripting.html">advanced scripting</a>.</p>

		<p>The preferred version of libpng is 1.6. However, installing this versions often conflicts
		with a lot of other precompiled packages usually compiled for libpng12. If you can install
		libpng16-devtools or libpng16-dev, Snowmix will prefer that version over version 1.2 and you can remove
		libpng12-dev from the list of files required to be installed. This file is listed in files
		in the bootstrapd directory of Snowmix.</p>

		<p>For Snowmix 0.5.2, libSDL has been upgraded from 1.2 to 2. Support for libSDL 1.2 is no longer
		supported from version 0.5.2. Replace libsdl1.2-dev with libsdl2-dev.</p>

		<p>The Python packages for Snowmix 0.5.2 are only needed if support for an embedded Python
		interpreter in Snowmix is desired. The packages to install are:</p>

		<code>sudo apt-get install python3-dev libpython3-dev</code>

		<p>The above commands are only for Ubuntu derrived distros. Please check the page 
		<a href="requirements.html#software">required packages</a> for specifics on which packages
		to install for your distro of choice.</p>

		<a name="gstreamer"><h3>GStreamer</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>GStreamer-1.0 (GStreamer 0.10 is no longer officially supported here nor at
		the GStreamer project) is needed by the demo examples and the scripts to feed
		audio and/or video streams to Snowmix and to read mixed video and/or audio from
		Snowmix.</p>

		<p><a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" target="_blank">GStreamer</a> versions 1.2.0-1.2.1
		have an issue with the alpha value (setting value to 127 instead of 255) when
		converting video streams from I420/YUV to BGRA.</p>

		<p><a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" target="_blank">GStreamer</a> versions 1.2.1-1.2.2
		have a performance issue (uses 2-4 times as much CPU) when converting video streams
		from I420/YUV to BGRA lowering the overall performance of a Snowmix video mixer system.</p>

		<p>Gstreamer versions 1.5.0-1.5.2 seems to have issues with Matroska mux and TS mux
		and demux, but appear otherwise to be fine.</p>

		<p>Due to these issues, the scripts of Snowmix will require GStreamer 0.10 if GStreamer
		1.2.0-1.2.2 is installed, but an upgrade to newer versions is strongly recommended.</p>

		<p>Snowmix version 0.5.1.1 was primarily tested using the 1.8.x to 1.16.x version 
		of <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" target="_blank">GStreamer</a>.
		The recommended version is 1.16.2 or newer.</p>

		<p>GStreamer ersion 1.6.3 was the recommended version for Snowmix 0.5.1 and
		GStreamer version 1.4.5 was the recommended version for Snowmix 0.5.0.</p>

		<p>Snowmix version 0.5.2 was primarily developed using the 1.8.x to 1.16.x version
		of <a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" target="_blank">GStreamer</a>.  The recommended
		<a href="http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/" target="_blank">GStreamer</a> version is
		GStreamer-1.16.2 or newer.

		<p>The basic GStreamer tools can on Ubuntu be installed by executing the following
		command although this may be an older version:</p>

		<code>$ sudo apt-get install gstreamer1.0-plugins-good gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad \
			gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly gstreamer1.0-libav gstreamer1.0-tools gstreamer1.0-alsa</code>

		<p>GStreamer packages for other platforms are listed for most on the <a href="requirements.html#software">required software</a> page.</p>

		<p>Because some modules like <i>faac</i> and others seem to be missing in some of the
		prebuilt binary packages of GStreamer, it is recommended, that you take the time to compile
		GStreamer yourself. Make sure to document how to in a script, so you have when GStreamer
		releases new versions. For most platforms, all you have to do is to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Download the following <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/" target="_blank">GStreamer modules</a>: <a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gstreamer" target="_blank">gstreamer</a>,
				<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-plugins-base" target="_blank">gst-plugins-base</a>,
				<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-plugins-good" target="_blank">gst-plugins-good</a>,
				<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-plugins-bad" target="_blank">gst-plugins-bad</a>,
				<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-plugins-ugly" target="_blank">gst-plugins-ugly</a>,
				<a href="https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/src/gst-libav" target="_blank">gst-libav</a>.</li>
			<li>Unpack the downloaded archives using <i>tar -xJvf PACKAGENAME.tar.xz</i></li>
			<li>Change directory into the PACKAGENAME and run the following for each</li>
		</ul>
		<code>./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
sudo ldconfig</code>

		<p>For each package, you can at the end of autogen.sh (actuallay it is after
		'./configure' performed by autogen) see which module elements that are included
		and which are not. It will for a lot of module element depends on whether or not
		you have the right libraries and development (typical the devel version) files
		for header files installed on your system. It takes some times to go through, but
		it is worth it.</p>

		<p>Please note that building GStreamer with autotools will for version 1.17 and newer
		no longer be supported as the <a href="https://mesonbuild.com/" target="_blank">Meson Build System</a>.

<p>Alternative to compile and install GStreamer yourself, the
<a a href="../Intro/faq.html#consultancy">author of Snowmix</a> can do it for you for a smaller fee.</p>

		<div align="right"><a href="">Top</a></div>
	</div>

	<div class="item">

		<a name="tcl"><h3>Tcl/Tk</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>If you want to run the GUI utilities such as snowaudio.tcl for
		controlling audio, snowscene.tcl for controlling scenes or snowoutput.tcl
		to monitor output timing and buffers, you will need Tcl/Tk and BWidgets.
		To install these packages on a Ubuntu platform execute one of the following depending on Ubuntu version:</p>

<code>$ sudo apt-get install tcl8.6 tk8.6 bwidget tcl8.6-dev
$ sudo apt-get install tcl8.5 tk8.5 bwidget tcl8.5-dev
$ sudo apt-get install tcl tk bwidget tcl-dev</code>

		<p>Once again, the boostrap script supplied with Snowmix will offer to install the required
		packages, Tcl and Tk tools included for all supported platforms.</p>
		<div align="right"><a href="">Top</a></div>

	</div>

	<div class="item">

		<a name="compile"><h3>Compiling Snowmix:</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>Unpack the Snowmix package, enter the main directory and run the bootstrap script.
		The script may be needed to run more than once if packages are missing. After running
		the bootstrap script, you can rerun the configure program with your own customized
		settings. After bootstrap and the optional configure process, you run the make
		command as shown below:</p>

		<code>$ tar -xzvf Snowmix-0.5.1.1.tar.gz
$ cd Snowmix-0.5.1.1
$ ./bootstrap
$ make</code>

		<p>That's it. Please <strong>pay attention</strong> to what the bootstrap script
		will tell you when it finish, hopefully without any errors. At the end of the
		boostrap script you will be told something like this:</p>

<code>You can rerun ./configure --prefix=YOUR_INSTALLATION_DIR if you need to change the installation path for Snowmix

You can revert the bootstrap script by executing the command './strapboot'

>>>>>>>>>> PLEASE NOTE <<<<<<<<<<<<
By default the Snowmix will be installed in /usr/local. If you want to
change this, please run ./configure --prefix=YOUR_CHOICE

If Snowmix is installed into /usr/local you need to set the enviroment
variable SNOWMIX to /usr/local/lib/Snowmix-0.5.1.1

Consider adding the following to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile

   export SNOWMIX=/usr/local/lib/Snowmix-0.5.1.1

Then after finishing this script, logout and login again to continue

Press return to continue 

Now you can compile Snowmix and install snowmix using the following commands:

  make
  sudo make install

After that, you can run Snowmix by executing the command

    snowmix ini/YOUR_INI_FILE

Or you can run the demo by executing the command 'snowmix_demo'

For questions and help, please use the discussion forum at http://sourceforge.net/projects/snowmix/
where you in the Wiki also can find a lot of documentation, examples and help.
See also website http://snowmix.sourceforge.net/ for ressources and documentation </code>

		<p>Please read what the boostrap script tells you and take the actions it suggests.</p>

		<p>After succefully running make, you now have the binary <i>snowmix</i> in the src
		directory. You can change the default installation directory through the <i>configure</i>
		command before running the make command. Use <i>./configure --help</i> for more information.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="item">

		<a name="nosudo"><h3>Bootstrapping without sudo</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>If all required packages/libraries are installed, you can choose to skip the bootstrap
		script all together and run the following commands manually eliminating running sudo
		in the bootstrap script. The commands for non macOS are:</p>

		<code>$ tar -xzvf Snowmix-0.5.1.1.tar.gz
$ cd Snowmix-0.5.1.1
$ aclocal
$ autoconf
$ libtoolize --force
$ automake --add-missing
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local
$ make
$ sudo make install</code>

		<p>For macOS you need to replace <i>libtoolize</i> with <i>glibtoolize</i> and usually set the <i>--prefix</i>
		to <i>/opt/local</i>.</p>

		<p><strong>Linux OpenSUSE</strong> - All works but see note.</p>
			OpenSUSE Leap 15.1 All works, but see note. (VirtualBox 6.1.10)</br>
			  - By default OpenSUSE does not include non-free (patent disputed)
			    codecs such as AAC/H.264. These are required for the snowmix_demo.
			    The bootstrap program will offer to add repos and packages
			    that will fix this, If you do not say yes to adding repos
			    and packages during running bootstrap, Snowmix will still
			    compile and work, but the snowmix_demo will not fully work
			    and you are on your own regarding support for the mentioned
			    codecs. But you may not need them depending on what you want
			    to use Snowmix for.</br>
			  - By default the distro comes with the package gstreamer-plugins-cogl.
				See <a href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=39126" target="_blank">GNU bugs report log #39126</a></p>

			    <p>GStreamer element autovideosink does not work in VirtualBox

        	<p><u>OpenGL (glshapes) on macOS:</u></p>

        	<p>OSMesa (Off Screen Rendering - CPU based) works for all macOS version
        albeit it is slow (CPU based).</p>

        GLX (X11 Rendering - GPU based ) is fast, but require an X11 server
        for macOS. Snowmix has been tested with the free X11 server from
        XQuartz version 2.7.11 from the website <a href="https://www.xquartz.org/" target="_blank">for XQuartz</a>.</p>

        <p>GLX based rendering does not seem to work with macOS as guest OS on
        VirtualBox. Snowmix reports wrong pixel formats and may sometime crash.
        However it did earlier work on Yosemite and Quartz 2.7.something
        propbably 2.7.7 or earlier.</p>

        <p>GLX has been tested with Sierra, XQuartz and running on a MacbookPro
        where it often works, but sometimes it does not. This require debugging
        beyond the scope of this release. So GPU based OpenGL does not work for
        Snowmix-0.5.1.1 on macOS (may work on older than Sierra).</p>

		<a name="python"><h3>Including Support for embedded Python interpreter</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>The embedded Python interpreter introduced with Snowmix 0.5.2 is alpha code
		and must be specifically requested included at compile time. Python is not available

		<p>To include support
		for Python, you must specify it to be included before compiling. The following command
		includes support for Python:</p>

		<code>$ cd TO_WHERE_THE_SNOWMIX_CODE_TREE_RESIDES
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --enable-snowmixpython --prefix=/usr/local --libdir=/usr/local/lib
$ make clean
$ make
$ sudo make install</code>

		<p>Note that on Mac OS X, the prefix should be /opt/local.</p>

		<p>You can use the following command to list the flags you can set for the configure command
		after running the bootstrap command:</p>

		<code>./configure --help</code>

		<br/>

		<p>Because <a href="../Documentation/guide-glshapes.html">Glshapes</a> introduced
		in version 0.5.0 is still alpha-code in Snowmix version 0.5.2, you need to compile or
		recompile Snowmix to include support for Glshapes. To do this you will need to execute
		the following commands:</p>

		<code>$ cd TO_WHERE_THE_SNOWMIX_CODE_TREE_RESIDES
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --enable-snowmixosmesa --enable-snowmixx11 --enable-snowmixglu --enable-snowmixglut \
	--prefix=/usr/local --libdir=/usr/local/lib
$ make clean
$ make
$ sudo make install</code>

		<p>Please note that Mac OS X users and others, may want to use the prefix to be
		/opt/local and libdir to be /opt/local/lib or whatever is preferred on the platform.</p>

		<p>OpenGL has not been tested on the ARMv7 platform. Most implementations
		with ARMv7 offers OpenGL ES as opposed to regular OpenGL. Quite likely only
		few changes to Snowmix will be necessary to get Snowmix to work with OpenGL ES,
		but this is currently untested.</p>

		<a name="installing"><h3>Installing Snowmix:</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>From Snowmix version 0.5.0 and newer, Snowmix is supposed to be installed before running. You can technically
		run Snowmix without installing it by setting the enviroment variable SNOWMIX to the base of
		Snowmix's directory. However then you are on your own. To install you need to execute the following
		command:</p>

<code> $ make install </code>

		<p>However unless you set installation directory in the configuration process to be something writable, or you are root, you may have to do:</p>

<code> $ sudo make install </code>

		<p>From Snowmix version 0.5.0 and newer, Snowmix is intended to be installed and has been tested as such.</p>
		<div align="right"><a href="">Top</a></div>

	</div>

	<div class="item">

		<a name="test"><h3>Testing and running Snowmix:</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>It is strongly advised <strong>not to run Snowmix as root</strong>. Testing Snowmix
		requires that you have installed a complete set of GStreamer and GStreamer plugins.
		You will need the plugin-base, plugin-good, plugin-bad, plugin-ugly and plugin-libav.
		On how to to install GStreamer and these plugins, if not already installed by
		the bootstrap script or by other means earlier, please use Google to search for help.</p>

		<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Before running any of the scripts, you need to set the
		enviroment variable SNOWMIX as explained by the end of the boostrap script.</p>

		<p>A permanent solution would be to add the following to your .bash_rc file
		in your home directory:</p>

		<code>export SNOWMIX=/usr/local/lib/Snowmix-0.5.2</code>

		<p><strong>Please note</strong> that the actual setting depends on where you
		installed your Snowmix collection.</p>

		<p>On Mac OS X you should set the SNOWMIX variable in your ~/.bash_profile.
		PLEASE see the section further down on installing Snowmix on the Mac OS X
		platform regarding the SNOWMIX variable and the installation path.</p>

		<p>When Snowmix has been installed and you have set your SNOWMIX environment variable
		permanently and logged out and in again, you can now run the Snowmix demo as test:</p>

		<code>$ snowmix_demo</code>

		<p>This demo will open one terminal window for Snowmix, one experimental audio mixer
		based on Tcl/Tk, one terminal running output of audio and video as well as more terminal
		windows running test input streams. If all goes well, you will hear audio and see a
		window with the mixed result depending on which menu point you choose when running the demo.</p>

		<p>If you want to test individual ini files, you can do so using the following commands and
		replacing the *some_ini_file* with your choice of ini file. Available ini files are found in
		the $SNOWMIX/ini directory and ~/.snowmix/ini directory.</p>

<code># In a terminal window
$ cd
$ snowmix ini/some_ini_file

# In another terminal window
$ xterm -e bash output2screen

# In a third terminal window
$ xterm -e bash input2feed 1
</code>


		<p>In the window running Snowmix, you can now type Snowmix commands. To begin with, you can
		type 'help' and press return. Type 'quit' when you want to stop Snowmix. If you terminate
		Snowmix in any other way, some of the shared memory allocated will stay allocate and build
		up until you can not start Snowmix again. Allocated shared memory can be found listed
		in /run/shm or /dev/shm (on Linux) and can be deallocated by deleting files in there.
		The files you need to delete are /run/shm/shmpipe*. However if you don't know what you
		are doing, bets are you will create problems for you and your machine. If you delete the
		shm files there, you will have to restart your GStreamer pipelines.</p>
		<div align="right"><a href="">Top</a></div>

	</div>




	<div class="item">
		<a name="coredumps"><h3>Core Dumps.</h3></a>

		<p>Snowmix will core dump if the shared memory file system is full. On Linux you can see the state of the shared memory file system is full by executing the command:</p>

<code> $ df -k /run/shm </code>

		<p>If Snowmix exits abnormally (or by using CTRL-C), Snowmix will leave shared memory allocated. If this happens a couple of times, you will eventually run out of shared memory space. The allocated shared memory space can be released by deleting the files /run/shm/shmpipe*. However if you do that, you will have to restart your GStreamer pipelines feeding Snowmix and reading from Snowmix.</p>

		<p>The following is no longer thought to be true, but left here for later inspection. In the code in controller.cpp Snowmix will core dump when calling mmap() after shm_open() and ftruncate(). So far I don't know how to prevent it. Suggestions and hints are welcomed. This problem however seems to have gone, though it has not yet been fully verified.</p>

		<a name="osx"><h3>Compiling Snowmix for Mac OS X.</h3></a>
		<br/>

		<p>Snowmix compiles on Mac OS_X Lion, Mountain Lion, Maverick, Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave,
		Catalina and possibly Big Sur. It might also work on older Snow Leopard, but it has not been tested.</p>


	<h3>Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave, HighSierra, Sierra, ElCapitan, Yosemite, Maverick and Mountain Lion</h3>

		<p>To compile Snowmix on OS X on Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave, HighSierra, Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite, Maverick
		and Mountain Lion, you need to install Xcode, which Apple
		provide through App Store for free.
		So install Xcode first and possibly the Command Line Utilities.
		The bootstrap script will check for the Utilities and offer to
		be download and install it if missing.</p>

	<h3>Lion and Snowleopard</h3>

		<p>To compile Snowmix on OS X on Lion and Snowleopard you first
		need to install Xcode, which Apple may no longer provide through
		App Store for free. Then you need to download
		the Command Line Utilities and install this package as the
		bootscript <strong>can not do this</strong>. You can find the
		Utilities for Lion on the Apple Developer website, but for
		Snowleopard you may have to search elsewhere.</p>

	<h3>Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave, HighSierra, Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite, Maverick, Mountain Lion, Lion and Snowleopard.</h3>

		<p>The boostrap script will offer to download and install
		<a href="https://www.macports.org/" target="_blank">port for Mac</a> as well as a number of
		libraries mentioned in the Linux Section. It will also offer to download
		and install GStreamer for Mac for you. If you have a GStreamer version older
		than 1.8.0, you may want to remove that version before running the bootstrap script.</p>

		<p>When Xcode has been installed (and started to acknowledge various licenses etc. and Snowmix
		has been downloaded to your Download directory, you can execute the following commands to compile Snowmix:</p>

<code>$ cd $HOME
$ mkdir Developer
$ cd Developer
$ tar -xzvf $HOME/Downloads/Snowmix-0.5.1.1.tar.gz
$ echo 'export PATH=/opt/local/bin:/Library/Frameworks/GStreamer.framework/Commands' >>~/.bash_profile
$ echo 'export SM=$HOME/Developer/Snowmix-0.5.1.1' >>~/.bash_profile
$ echo 'export SNOWMIX=/opt/local/lib/Snowmix-0.5.1.1' >>~/.bash_profile
</code>

		<p>Please note the use of <u>single quotes</u> as opposed to double quotes.</p>

		<p>What you set the SNOWMIX enviroment variable depends on what
		you have selected when you ran the <i>configure</i> sctipt. If
		you ran the <i>configure</i> script through the <i>bootstrap</i>
		script, Snowmix will be installed into /opt/local/lib/Snowmix-<i>VERSION</i>
		for the OS X platform when you run the installation command. If
		however you ran the <i>configure</i> script afterwards, it will
		depend if you specified a path for the prefix. The <i>configure</i>
		script used without argument, will by default select an installation
		path in /usr/local rather than /opt/local. The bootstrap script may install
		<a href="https://www.macports.org/" target="_blank"><i>port</i></a> packages into the
		<i>/opt</i> tree by default.</p>

		<p>Now logout and login again for changes to take effect and then run the following
		commands <u>assuming you did set the PATH</u> to include /opt/local/bin :</p>

<code>$ cd $SM
$ ./bootstrap
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ snowmix_demo</code>

		<p>If '/opt/local/bin' is not included in your PATH environment
		variable as described, the bootstrap script may not fail, but
		subsequent executing "make" probably will.</p>

		<p>If you do not allow the <i>bootstrap</i> script to install any possibly
		missing packages and tools, the subseqent <i>make</i> command is likely to
		fail unless all required software is installed and found.</p>

		<p>If GStreamer is not in your PATH environment variable as described above,
		the demo script is likely to fail.</p>

		<p>Reports on success and failures on the Mac OS X platform are very welcome
		in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/snowmix/discussion/" target="_blank">Support Forum</a>.</p>

		<p><strong>Important</strong>.
		The Tcl GUI scripts works poorly on OS X if tcl/tk and wish is not version 8.6.
		Recommended version is 8.6.4 or newer. By default Mavericks and earlier versions of
		Mac OS X have by default a Tcl version earlier than 8.6. If you have an OS X based
		system upgraded several versions, you may have several versions of Tcl installed
		all over the system. Some of them may even be version Tcl 8.4. This need to be cleaned.
		New Tcl can be downloaded for free from
		<a href="http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/downloads" target="_blank">ActiveState Download</a>.</p>
